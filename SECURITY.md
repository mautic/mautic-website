The timelines we aim to follow are:

- Within one week every report gets acknowledged.
- Within 14 days every report gets a further response stating either:
    - the issue is closed (and why);
    - the issue is still under investigation; if needed, additional information will be requested;
    - the expected close date.
- Within 21 days every report should be resolved unless there are exceptional circumstances requiring additional time.

## Scope

This policy applies to all files and code in this repository, including custom code and configuration for our WordPress website.
